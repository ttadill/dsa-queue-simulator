## Assignment
Assignment #1 – Implementing Queue for Traffic Light Simulation

## Description
This project simulates a traffic junction using queue data structures.
Vehicles arrive at multiple lanes, wait in queues, and are processed
based on traffic light conditions and priority rules.

## Features
- Queue-based vehicle management
- Priority lane handling (AL2)
- File-based communication between generator and simulator
- Real-time simulation output

## Technologies
- Python 3
- Queue data structure
- File I/O

## How to Run
